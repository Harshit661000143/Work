[We have similar ideas for the project which improves the search results based on user's history. Today search engines save user's history but still they often fail to give relevant results. We can optimize this by identifying how much history should be used to make search results relevant. We can add larger weights to the previous immediate queries assuming they were from the same context. How do you suggest to use user's history?  Moreover as discussed in your essay we can add advanced search which confines the search results to particular subject.]

[I think we have similar ideas to refine user's search query and save the time wasted in bogus surfing. Immediate search queries could be clustered and then using them as filters in different permutations of the query order may be useful. Do you have other ideas of using user's history. Also if user is aware about such mechanism he may be able to give smarter queries which helps in batching process.]
